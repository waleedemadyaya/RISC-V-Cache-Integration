# RISC-V-Cache-Integration
RISC-V with Direct-Mapped Cache is a digital design project that integrates a single-cycle RISC-V processor with a direct-mapped cache memory system. This repository provides a comprehensive solution for implementing and testing a RISC-V processor combined with a cache to enhance data access efficiency and performance.
